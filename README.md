# Introduction
Nashville Software School Cohort 46 Capstone - My Food Journal

## The Purpose of My Food Journal
The main purpose of My Food Journal application is to help users with gastrointestinal issues document foods that they have eaten for each day.

This application will allow logged in users to: document their daily meals, determine which foods trigger gastrointestinal issues, rate each of their meals and notate how each meal physically made the user feel after consuming each food item, and notate their daily bowel movements.

This application will help users determine which foods triggered gastrointestinal issues so that the user can avoid and/or eliminate those foods from the users diet.
